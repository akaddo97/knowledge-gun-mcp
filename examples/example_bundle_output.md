## Static brief

## What this studio is

Lantern-Bough Games is a six-person independent game studio founded in 2021 by Maya Okonkwo. It is small by intent. The headcount has not crossed seven in three years, the project count has not crossed three at any one time, and the funding model has stayed inside what the studio can absorb without taking equity capital. Lantern-Bough makes narrative-led games that lean on atmosphere, hand-drawn pixel art and adaptive sound rather than scope or systems density.

The arc the studio tells about itself is small games done well. The first project (Cinder Path) was a roguelike prototype that died at a design dead-end. The second (Tide Études) shipped in 2024 — a procedural-music puzzle game that did modest commercial numbers but earned a strong critical reception and paid for itself plus the next eighteen months of runway. The third and current project (Paper Lanterns) is the flagship — atmospheric, narrative-led, scoped to roughly a year of remaining work as of early 2025.

## What it is doing now

The studio's centre of gravity is Paper Lanterns. Maya is creative directing; Jonas Lindqvist is engineering lead on gameplay systems and tooling; Priya Balasubramanian is art director with the handpainted-pixel + parallax house style; Diego Alvarez is composing and designing adaptive audio; Sarah Chen is writing the branching dialogue and worldbuilding; Amir Hassan is producing — schedules, contracts, partner relationships.

Lantern-Bough publishes through Lantern Press (the studio's long-standing publishing partner) and distributes via Hollow Bough Distribution on the digital storefront side. Tide Études was funded in part by the Indie Haven Fund's 2022 grant cycle; Cinder Path was the same fund's 2021 cycle. Paper Lanterns is self-funded from Tide Études' revenue plus a small Lantern Press marketing advance.

## Where the studio sits geographically

The studio is officially headquartered in Lisbon, where Maya, Priya and Sarah are based. Jonas and Amir work out of Montréal. Diego works out of Kyoto. The team has operated as remote-first since founding; in-person sessions happen twice a year (a planning week each February and a milestone retreat each September) and rotate between Lisbon and Montréal.

## Design philosophy in one paragraph

The studio's manifesto, drafted in 2024, names three principles: emergent storytelling over scripted beats, modest scope over feature ambition, and sustainable pace over crunch. Diegetic UI and player-authored meaning are recurring motifs in the work. The seasonal release cadence (winter sale, summer sale) is treated as a planning input rather than a deadline forcer — the studio has slipped past one storefront moment per project and considers that an acceptable cost.

## What the studio is not

It is not a service studio. It does not work for hire. It does not take equity capital. It does not make multiplayer titles, mobile titles, free-to-play titles, or anything live-service. The team has explicitly turned down acquisition conversations on three occasions since 2023 and the founder has been on record (in interviews around the Tide Études release) that ownership independence is load-bearing for the kind of games the studio wants to make.

## How to use this bundle

Read it once, then reply at the level of detail it implies. Push back
when the user is being generic; ask one clarifying question rather than
guessing when context is missing. This bundle is the studio lens on the underlying knowledge graph. Other lenses available: industry, projects, team.
